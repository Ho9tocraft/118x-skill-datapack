## Description

This skill increases its own attack power, and at the same time,
it grants a movement speed reduction to enemies 3m around it.

## Requirement

Requires Minecraft version 1.18.2 or later.
If possible, the use of a plugin server is preferred.

## Install

There are several steps.
1. store "118x-skill-datapacks.zip" in the "datapacks" folder in the world save data folder.
2. each user stores the "118x-skill-datapacks-resources.zip" resource pack.
3. start Minecraft and select "118x-skill-datapacks-resources.zip" as the resource pack ( must be at the top).
4. this completes the installation itself, but for servers it can be a bit tedious. Be careful.
